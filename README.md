1.	**Overview of Analysis**

The purpose of this analysis is to identify temperature trends to establish potential success of a Surf and Ice Cream shop. We grabbed data to compare temperature information for the months of June and December. We want to know if this Surf and Ice Cream shop can sustain business year-round. 

2.	**Results:**

•	The average temperature in June is almost 4 degrees warmer than in December. 

•	The median temperature in June is 4 degrees warmer than in December.

•	The minimum temperature for June is 64 degrees, where for December the minimum temperature is 56 degrees. 


3.	**Summary:**
	
Overall the temperature data for June and December are close. Both the median and mean temperatures are in the 70’s which suggests (based on temperature) that June and December should see similar business. Based on temperature the business should be sustainable year-round. 

However, before deciding I suggest gathering some more information. I recommend that we analyze cloudiness (rain) data and water temperature data. Knowing how the water temperature changes and how much sunshine we can expect will influence business at our shop. 

I would also like to know vacationer patterns. Business may not be sustainable year-round based on tourism. It would be important to see how the influx of vacationers influence local businesses compared to the normal population.
